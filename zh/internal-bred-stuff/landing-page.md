# 1. 简介

面包是人类历史上最古老的准备食品之一，其来源可追溯到农业开始之初的1万多年。 它标志着人类从狩猎－采集者生活方式过渡到耕作，为我们今天所了解和生活的社会类型奠定了基础。 正如人类一样，它已经从早期的平面演变成无数的品种，同时也使用同样的基本成份：面粉、水、盐和青年。

# 2. BredOS

At BredOS, we cherish the concept of using basic ingredients—selected with love and passion—to craft a simple yet versatile product that you can customize to your taste. Served plain, it has the potential to transform into whatever you desire. Whether sweet or salty, light or dark, big enough to enjoy it with your family or small enough to carry it around your adventures.
