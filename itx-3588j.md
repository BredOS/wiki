# 1. Introduction
The Firefly ITX-3588J is a somewhat unusual device compared to other RK3588 SBCs. This page lists some articles that mention its quirks and how to fix or work around them.

# 2. Download
You can find download links for images in our [website](https://bredos.org/download.html)!

# 3. SATA Controller
Some, if not all, boards have shipped with broken SATA controller firmware. 
If you see the following error, you've likely received one of them:
> ata1.01: exception Emask 0x100 SAct 0x8228c11 SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen
> ata1.01: failed command: WRITE FPDMA QUEUED
> ata1.01: cmd 61/80:00:80:d1:08/00:00:00:00:00/40 tag 0 ncq dma 65536 out
>           res 40/00:00:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/00 Emask 0x4 (timeout)
> ata1.01: status: { DRDY }
{.is-warning}


To flash the correct firmware, follow this [how-to](/en/itx-3588j/sata-firmware-fix).

# 4. Bluetooth
Unlike other SBCs, the Bluetooth adapter is *not* attached to /dev/ttyS6, but to /dev/ttyS9. If you have trouble activating Bluetooth, follow this guide.

# 5. HDMI
There are known issues with all HDMI ports (input and output). The upper HDMI output is disabled by the BIOS, and the bottom one is disabled by the OS. This may be fixed in the future, but for now, just avoid using HDMI and instead use VGA or DisplayPort/HDMI over USB-C.

# 6. mini PCIe / NVME
These connectors are not connect over PCIe to the RK3588. If you did know already, the specs of these port types allows a connection over USB. This is normally used to handle WiFi/Bluetooth combi cards. While WiFi is connected over PCIe, Bluetooth is over USB.
Firefly wisly decided to only connect USB on those. There are breakoutcards that give you a fullsized USB3 or internal USB3 port over at AliExpress.
