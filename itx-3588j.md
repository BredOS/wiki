# 1. Introduction
The Firefly ITX-3588J is a somewhat unusual device compared to other RK3588 SBCs. This page lists some articles that mention its quirks and how to fix or work around them.

> We nicknamed it "*Frisbee*" because it's better at flying than computing!

# 2. Download
You can find download links for images in our [website](https://bredos.org/download.html)!

# 3. SATA Controller
Some, if not all, boards have shipped with broken SATA controller firmware. 
- If you see the following error, you've likely received one of them:
```
sudo dmesg | grep ata
```
```
> ata1.01: exception Emask 0x100 SAct 0x8228c11 SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen
> ata1.01: failed command: WRITE FPDMA QUEUED
> ata1.01: cmd 61/80:00:80:d1:08/00:00:00:00:00/40 tag 0 ncq dma 65536 out
>           res 40/00:00:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/00 Emask 0x4 (timeout)
> ata1.01: status: { DRDY }
```


To flash the correct firmware, follow this [how-to](/itx-3588j/sata-firmware-fix).

# 4. Bluetooth
Unlike other SBCs, the Bluetooth adapter is *not* attached to `/dev/ttyS9`, but to `/dev/ttyS6`. If you have trouble activating Bluetooth, follow this [guide](/itx-3588j/Bluetooth-Fix).

# 5. HDMI
There are known issues with all HDMI ports (both input and output). The upper HDMI output is disabled by the BIOS, and the lower one is disabled by the OS. This may be fixed in the future; however, for now, avoid using HDMI and instead use VGA or DisplayPort/HDMI over USB-C.

# 6. Mini PCIe / NVME
If you weren't aware, the specifications of these port types allow for a USB connection. This is commonly used for handling WiFi/Bluetooth combo cards, with WiFi connected via PCIe and Bluetooth using USB.

Firefly wisely chose to connect only USB to these ports. Breakout cards, available on AliExpress, offer a full-sized USB 3.0 port or an internal USB 3.0 connection.

# 7. USB Gadget Mode
Despite the RK3588 implementing USB gadget mode on its USB Type-C port, it is not enabled on the Firefly ITX-3588J mainboard.
