# First Setup

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to Bakery, the place to mix, knot, and bake only the finest ingredients for your BredOS. With Bakery you will be guided through the entire process from picking the right flour to the best knoting technice to the exact amount of time it needs to rise. So let's get started!

### 2.2 Bred is enjoyed all over the world
Before we start our journey we need to know how we should comunicate the best. What language do you speak, what timeformat you use and what currency you are familar with?

Look up your prefered language and click on it. A window then pops up where you can choose your locale. Time and dateformat and your currency should be filled in automatically. Please check them before continuing and feel free to alter them to your preferences.

### 2.3 About the knotting technice
Let's talk about knotting. All humans are different so there is no "true" knotting technice. As we account for that you can choose you technice based on your country.

After you clicked on your country you can choose your layout. As its name suggests "Normal" is the layout mostly used. If you are unsure use this. If you have a unusual keyboard, like the ones apple sells, choose the layout accordingly.

> Use the textbar to test your layout. This is important later when you have to type in your password!

### 2.4 The process of rising
Here at Bakery we work with love. So we fully admit that Bred needs time to become the beloved product we all know. For that we need to know the timezone you are in.

Select your Region and Zone with the dropdown menus. Your current time then should show up just below them for you to make sure the time is set correctly.
### 2.5 While we wait, we get to know each other
Now that our dought is knotted and we know how long it will take it to rise, we have some time to know each better. Tell me, whats your name, do you have a nickname and what name would you give your Bred to if i would ask?
