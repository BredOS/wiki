# 1. Introduction
Many of our supported devices do offer support for `UEFI`, which is a modern firmware interface that initializes hardware and starts the operating system. With the help of `UEFI` your device is capable of booting .iso files (written to a USB-Stick or burned to a DVD) as well as booting your OS directly from the nVME drive or over the network via PXE.

# 2. Examine your device
Sadly, not all devices we support do support booting `UEFI`. Also, not every device does come with an SPI chip installed. 


- To determine what your device is capable of check [this table](/en/table-of-supported-devices).
