# 1. Introduction

Its always good to start with a short introduction. You are allowed to be a little funny here to get the readers attention

# 2. Headings
So what i did there?

## 2.1 Headings under Headings
I guess you got the gist?

# 3. Text

- This is how a codeblock with its explanation should look like:

```
sudo rm -fr / # to remove french language
```

> You may not run this!
{.is-warning}

Thats a warning block. A reader reads this even its after the codeblock. See what i did here?

Some words are important. Mark them as `inline code`.

# 4. Screenshots

- Do we need this here?

![steam_libs_selection.png](/steam_libs_selection.png)

guess not ...

# 5. Tables

This is a fine table. Not to big, with all neccessary information at one glance:

| Device            | UEFI  | Supported | Known Issues |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Orange Pi 5       |  ✔️    | ✔️        | Sata M.2 SSDs may not work|
| Orange Pi 5B      | ✔️     | ✔️        |Uses OPI5 image and requires DTBO for wifi to work|
| Orange Pi 5 Plus  | ✔️     | ✔️        |              |

But a better way would be to [link to it](/en/orangepi-5).
