# 5. 💽 Installation

To make installation easy for you, we laid out a line of bred crumbs to follow. 🍞 🔸🔸🔸

> If you found a bread crumb 🔸 give us a heads-up over at our community channels.

## 5.1 Device specific image installation

These are the boards we love the most. To install these BredOS images on them, either start with our [device specific image](/install/device-specific-image) installation guide, or take a glimpse to the device page at our wiki, which can be found in the navigation bar left of this.

Visit our [download site](https://bredos.org/download.html) to find out if your device is one of them.

## 5.2 Generic installation

If your device isn’t listed on our [download site](https://bredos.org/download.html) but supports booting UEFI and is based on either x86- or ARM64 architecture, simply follow our guide for a generic installation available [here](/install/Installation-with-ISO).

## 5.3 Docker container installation

- Easy as one line of command:

```
docker pull bredos/bredos
```

# 5. 🐞 Troubleshooting

Take a look at the device pages in the navigation bar on this page to find known issues specific to your device. If your problem is not listed there, feel free to contact us directly via [our support channels](#h-7-community-and-support).

# 9. Mainline Campaign

Right now, BredOS images for RK3588 devices rely on the crusty Rockchip BSP kernel — a huge, duct-taped codebase that’s hard to maintain, insecure, and always lags behind upstream Linux.

[We want to change that](/en/internal-bred-stuff/mainline-campaign).
