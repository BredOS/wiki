# 5. 💽 Installation

You can find download links for images in our [website](https://bredos.org/download.html)!

# 5. 安裝

To make installation easy for you, we laid out a line of bred crumbs to follow.

## 5.1 Device specific image installation

These are the boards we love the most. To install BredOS on them, either start with our [device specific image](/en/install/device-specific-image) installation guide, or take a glimpse to the device page at our wiki, which found in the navigation bar left of this.

Visit our [download site](https://bredos.org/download.html) to find out if your device is one of them.

## 5.2 Generic installation

If your device isn’t listed on our [download site](https://bredos.org/download.html) but supports booting UEFI and is based on either x86- or ARM64 architecture, simply follow our guide for a generic installation available [here](/install/Installation-with-ISO).

## 5.3 Docker container installation

- Easy as one line of command:

```
docker pull bredos/bredos
```

# 9. 🤝 Contributing

# 9. Mainline Campaign

Right now, BredOS images for RK3588 devices rely on the crusty Rockchip BSP kernel — a huge, duct-taped codebase that’s hard to maintain, insecure, and always lags behind upstream Linux.

[We want to change that](/en/internal-bred-stuff/mainline-campaign).
