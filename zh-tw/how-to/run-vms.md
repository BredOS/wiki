# 🚀 Running Virtual Machines with Virt-Manager on BredOS

This guide will help you set up and manage virtual machines using `virt-manager` on BredOS.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- A working internet connection 🌐
- Sudo privileges 🔑

## Step 1: Install Required Packages 📦

To start, you need to install the necessary packages for KVM and `virt-manager`.

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S virt-manager virt-viewer qemu-base qemu-system-aarch64 edk2-aarch64 dnsmasq 
```

## Step 2: Enable and Start the Libvirt Service 🖧

Once the packages are installed, enable and start the `libvirtd` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
```

To verify that the service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status libvirtd
```

## Step 3: Add Your User to the `libvirt` Group 👥

To avoid needing root privileges for managing VMs, add your user to the `libvirt` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG libvirt $(whoami)
```

After adding yourself to the group, log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

## Step 4: Configure Networking 🌐

`virt-manager` uses `dnsmasq` for network management. You may want to ensure `libvirt` is set up with default network settings:

```bash
sudo virsh net-start default
sudo virsh net-autostart default
```

## Step 5: Launch Virt-Manager 🖥️

Now that everything is set up, you can start `virt-manager`:

```bash
virt-manager
```

This will open the `virt-manager` GUI where you can create and manage virtual machines.

## Step 6: Enable XML editing

To enable XML editing (Needed later) you need to open `virt-manager` go to **Edit** then **Preferences** and enable XML editing

## Step 7: Create a Virtual Machine 🛠️

1. Open `virt-manager`.

2. Click on **Create a new virtual machine** ➕.

3. Select the installation source (ISO image or network install).

4. Follow the wizard to allocate CPU, RAM, and storage for your VM. ⚙️

> On the RK3588 you can allocate max 4 cores per vm due to the little big architecture

5. On CPUs with the little.big architecture like the RK3588 you need to check "Customize configuration before install" and edit the xml responsible for allocating cpu cores

Click **Finish**

Open the **CPUs** configuration and then the **XML** tab
![vcpuxml1.jpg](/vms/vcpuxml1.jpg)
Locate `<vcpu>XYZ</vcpu>` and replace it with

```xml
<vcpu placement='static' cpuset='0-1'>2</vcpu>
```

Where cpu set is the cores you want to use 0-3 are the E cores on the rk3588 and 4-7 are the performance cores and the number of cores. In the example above the vm will have 2 cores with them being efficiency cores aka cores 1 and 2 on the die itself.

6. Add peripheral hardware and graphics support. 🖥️

Head back to the VM page, press "Add Hardware".

Then from the window that will appear select "Video" and from the model selection, select "ramfb" and click "Finish".

Now to add the graphics server, select "Add hardware" again, "Graphics" and click "Finish".

Now for keyboard and mouse, repeat the same procedure by selecting:
"Input" -> "USB Keyboard"
and
"Input" -> "EvTouch USB Graphics Tablet"

7. Once configured, start the VM. 🟢

## Additional Configuration ⚙️

- To manage VMs via command line, you can use `virsh`:

```bash
virsh list --all
virsh start <vm-name>
virsh shutdown <vm-name>
```

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

- **Permission Issues**: Ensure your user is in the `libvirt` group and that the `libvirtd` service is running.
- **Networking Issues**: If VMs don't have internet access, ensure the default `virsh` network is running.

## 🎉 Conclusion

You have successfully set up `virt-manager` on BredOS and are ready to create and manage virtual machines!
