# Mesa 25.1 now on BredOS

BredOS has expedited the update to the Mesa 25.1 stack to bring you the Vulkan 1.2 conformant PanVK! <sup><sub>The Arch Linux ARM repos are eepy.</sub></sup>

### Users of the Panthor driver can now safely use vulkan

If you're already on Panthor (It's a change you perform manually), you can now install the proper vulkan package without sideffects:

```
yay -S vulkan-panfrost
```

### What's Panthor and what's Panfork?

Panfork is the default driver on BredOS on RK3588 devices.
It's faster but massively outdated.

The new display stack, which is part of mainline mesa, is much slower, but is a lot more modern and compatible with different pieces of software, now also providing proper Vulkan.
This display stack is named Panthor.

Switching to Panthor can be done by following the BredOS Guide:
