Devs can add notes to subfolders, which can later be turned into wiki articles by the writers. Notes may contain text or screenshots. **There is no design language requirement for dev notes.**

In each subfolder, you will also find our wiki article [design language](/en/internal-bred-stuff/design-language). If you are a new writer, **you are required to read it carefully and follow it strictly!**

> Always show respect and passion to help make BredOS the most well-known Arch-based distro for ARM and x86 devices known to mankind!
