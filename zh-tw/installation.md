# BredOS Installation Guide

To make installation easy for you, we laid out a line of bred crumbs to follow. 🍞 🔸🔸🔸

> If you find a bread crumb 🔸 give us a heads-up over at our community channels.

## Device specific image installation

These are the boards we love the most. To install BredOS on them, either start with our [device specific image](/en/install/device-specific-image) installation guide, or take a glimpse to the device page at our wiki, which found in the navigation bar left of this.

Visit our [download site](https://bredos.org/download.html) to find out if your device is one of them.

## Generic installation

If your device isn’t listed on our [download site](https://bredos.org/download.html) but supports booting UEFI and is based on either x86- or ARM64 architecture, simply follow our guide for a generic installation available [here](/install/Installation-with-ISO).

## Docker container installation

- Easy as one line of command:

```

docker pull bredos/bredos

```
