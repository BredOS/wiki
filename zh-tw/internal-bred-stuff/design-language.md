# 1. 簡介

This page describes the design language we follow for our articles. This set of rules is meant to keep the wiki coherent and easy to use.

> Always keep your articles as plain and simple as possible. Use the arch wiki as inspiration.
> {.is-info}

# 2. Headings

- Articles must contain headings

- Headings must be numbered.

- Headings with one # have one number. Headings with two ## have two-dot-two numbers. And so on...

# 3. Text

- The use of emojis is prohibited.

- An article must not exceed a certain length. If you need to scroll a lot, try to split parts of it into a separate guide.

- An article must not contain duplicates. If an article already exists, link to it!

- If you are using a code block, you are required to explain it just above the code block.

- If you are using a code block, its explanation must start with a hyphen (-) to render it as an item in an unordered list.

- Important words must be formatted as inline code. Don't overuse or underuse this feature.

- Important notes must be placed inside an infobox. The same rule applies to errors and warnings.

# 4. Screenshots and Photos

- Screenshot and photos must be of high quality.

- Screenshots are only allowed if necessary. Too many screenshots make it hard to find information.

- The content of a screenshot must be described in plain text above the picture. Its description must start with a hyphen (-) to render it as an item in an unordered list.

- An article must not consist of screenshots only.

- Screenshots must not exceed 1000px in height or width.

# 5. Graphs and tables

- The table must be described in plain text above the table. Its description must start with a hyphen (-) to render it as an item in an unordered list.

- Tables must not exceed a certain size. If you need to scroll through it a lot consider splitting it up.

- The use of graphs is prohibited.
