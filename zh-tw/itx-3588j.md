# 簡介

The Firefly ITX-3588J is a somewhat unusual device compared to other RK3588 SBCs. This page lists some articles that mention its quirks and how to fix or work around them.

# Download

You can find download links for images in our [website](https://bredos.org/download.html)!

# SATA Controller

Some, if not all, boards have shipped with broken SATA controller firmware. To flash the correct firmware, follow this how-to.

# Bluetooth

Unlike other SBCs, the Bluetooth adapter is _not_ attached to /dev/ttyS6, but to /dev/ttyS9. If you have trouble activating Bluetooth, follow this guide.

# HDMI

There are known issues with all HDMI ports (input and output). The upper HDMI output is disabled by the BIOS, and the bottom one is disabled by the OS. This may be fixed in the future, but for now, just avoid using HDMI and instead use VGA or DisplayPort/HDMI over USB-C.
