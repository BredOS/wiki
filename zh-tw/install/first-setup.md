# First Setup

## 1. 簡介

Welcome to Bakery, the place to mix, knead, and bake only the finest ingredients for your BredOS. With Bakery you will be guided through the entire process from picking the right flour to the best knoting technice to the exact amount of time it needs to rise. So let's get started!

## 2. Bakery

### 2.1 Warm Welcome

Bakery starts automatically on boot, as long as the setup hasn't been completed. There's also a desktop shortcut to launch it without rebooting. To begin the setup, choose between an online or offline installation.

> Online Installation is under construction right now. Please use offline install.

### 2.2 Bred is enjoyed all over the world

Before we start our journey, we need to agree on how to communicate best. What language do you speak? What time format do you use? And what currency you are familiar with?
![2-scaled.png](/first-setup/2-scaled.png)
Look up your prefered language and click on it. A window will then pop up where you can choose your locale. The time and date format, as well as your currency, should be filled in automatically. Please check them before continuing and feel free to adjust them to your preferences.

### 2.3 About the kneading technice

Let's talk about kneading. Everyone is different, so there is no single 'true' kneading technique. To accommodate this, you can choose you technice based on your country.

After you click on your country you can choose your layout. As the name suggests "Normal" is the layout most commonly used. If you are unsure use this. If you have an unusual keyboard, like those sold by Apple, choose the layout accordingly.

> Use the textbar to test your layout. This is important later when you have to type in your password!

### 2.4 The process of rising

Here at Bakery, we work with love. We fully admit that Bred needs time to become the beloved product we all know. For that, we need to know your time zone.

Select your Region and Zone using the dropdown menus. Your current time should then appear just below, so you can verify that the time is set correctly.

### 2.5 While we wait, we get to know each other

Now that our dough is kneaded and we know how long it will take to rise, we have some time to get to know each other better. Tell me, what’s your name? Do you have a nickname? And what name would you give your Bred if I asked?
![10-scaled.png](/first-setup/10-scaled.png)
Please fill in your name, username, and hostname. The hostname will be used as a friendly name on your network. Then enter your password twice. You can use the eye icon to show or hide your password.

If you want to disable password protection for sudo and polkit, toggle the switch accordingly.

> Please be aware that disabling password-protection does allow to run a program at root-level without password! This **can** be dangerous!
> {.is-danger}

Every user has an ID assigned to them. This ID is used internally by programs, the file system, and more. You can change it if you want, but usually, there’s no need to.

If you want to skip the LightDM login screen and log in to your system without a password, toggle the switch accordingly.

### 2.6 The oven is heated up

Now that the dough has risen and the oven is hot, we pause to check that we did not forget anything. Luckily Bakery has automatically created a checklist for us.

Please check that everything is included: flour, water, salt, and yeast. Was the kneading done properly? Did we let the dough rise long enough? If everything is okay, hit 'Install'.

### 2.7 There is no better smell than fresh Bred

Now grab a coffee or tea and stare into the oven for a while. Reflect on what you’ve learned in the Bakery while the pleasant smell of Bred tickles your nose. Enjoy this waiting time with eager anticipation as your Bred finishes baking.

### 2.8 Enjoy your Bred

Serve your Bred however you like it — plain, with cheese and marmalade, a generous amount of sriracha sauce, or with a nice, fresh fried egg. We know that Bred can be enjoyed in countless ways, and we love them all.

Now sit down and get comfy with your BredOS. See this as your starting point, not the destination. Feel free to customize everything to your liking, and don’t hesitate to share your questions, experiences, and cool projects on our Discord and Telegram channels.
