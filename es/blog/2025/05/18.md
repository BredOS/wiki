# Mesa 25.1 ahora en BredOS

Más rápido que los repos Arch Linux ARM (esos chicos están durmiendo),
BredOS ha acelerado la actualización a la Mesa 25. ¡Apilado para traerte el PanVK conforme a Vulkan 1.2!

### Users of the Panthor driver can now safely use vulkan

If you're already on Panthor (It's a change you perform manually), you can now install the proper vulkan package without sideffects:

```
yay -S vulkan-panfrost
```

### What's Panthor and what's Panfork?

Panfork is the default driver on BredOS on RK3588 devices.
It's faster but massively outdated.

The new display stack, which is part of mainline mesa, is much slower, but is a lot more modern and compatible with different pieces of software, now also providing proper Vulkan.
This display stack is named Panthor.

Switching to Panthor can be done by following the BredOS Guide:
