# 1. Introducci√≥n

El pan es uno de los alimentos preparados m√°s antiguos de la historia de la humanidad, con sus or√≠genes que se remontan a m√°s de 10.000 a√±os al amanecer de la agricultura. Significa la transici√≥n del estilo de vida de los cazadores a la agricultura, sentando las bases para el tipo de sociedad que conocemos y vivimos hoy. Al igual que la humanidad, ha evolucionado, desde los primeros planos hasta innumerables variedades, utilizando todos los mismos ingredientes b√°sicos: harina, agua, sal y levadura.

# 2. BredOS

At BredOS, we cherish the concept of using basic ingredients‚Äîselected with love and passion‚Äîto craft a simple yet versatile product that you can customize to your taste. Served plain, it has the potential to transform into whatever you desire. Whether sweet or salty, light or dark, big enough to enjoy it with your family or small enough to carry it around your adventures.
