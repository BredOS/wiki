## 3.1 Viewing S.M.A.R.T Data (HDD)

Assuming hard disk `/dev/sda`, to view it's S.M.A.R.T data, run:
```
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda
```

This will print out a large report:

```

Out of all of this, the following data are important to look for:

 - `SMART overall-health self-assessment`, which should be "PASSED". If any other value is reported, the drive should be replaced with haste.
 - `Reallocated_Sector_Ct`, the number of relocated sectors, which if more than a single one indicates significant risk of cascading failure.

## 3.2 Viewing S.M.A.R.T Data (NVME)

Assuming NVME `/dev/nvme0`, to view it's S.M.A.R.T data, run:
```
sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvme0
```

Assuming the NVME supports S.M.A.R.T, this will print out a small report:

```

Here, the only important values are:
 - `Percentage Used`, which is the percentage of used spare blocks. It should not exceed `Available Spare Threshold`, since that usually is the point of no return for the drive.
 The rate of block failure will usually exponentially increase passed that point, leading to complete failure.
 NVME drives are likely to lock up and turn Read-Only once spare flash is exausted.
 - `Media and Data Integrity Errors`, which indicate significant flash degredation.
 - `Error Information Log Entries`, which usually indicate how many flash regions have been masked with spare flash.

## 3.3 Should I replace the drive?

If you have just a few (<5) relocated sectors, it's probably fine to keep using the disk for a little while.
Using a few spare nvme flash blocks is also fine.

However burning through spare flash or rapidly relocating dozens of sectors is however a sign of imminent failure.

As the spare flash or sectors run out, the system's performance will rapidly degrade and filesystems like BTRFS will lock up, refusing to perform writes to ensure it does not corrupt the disk.
