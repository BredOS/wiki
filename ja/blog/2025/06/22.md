With `20250613.12fe085f-5`, Arch split the firmware package into several vendor-focused packages. `linux-firmware` is now an empty package.

Unfortunately, this coincided with upstream reorganizing the symlink layout of the NVIDIA firmware, resulting in a situation that Pacman cannot handle. When attempting to upgrade from `20250508.788aadc8-2` or earlier, you will see the following errors:

```
linux-firmware-nvidia: /usr/lib/firmware/nvidia/ad103 exists in filesystem
linux-firmware-nvidia: /usr/lib/firmware/nvidia/ad104 exists in filesystem
linux-firmware-nvidia: /usr/lib/firmware/nvidia/ad106 exists in filesystem
linux-firmware-nvidia: /usr/lib/firmware/nvidia/ad107 exists in filesystem
```

To progress with the system upgrade, first remove linux-firmware, then reinstall it as part of the upgrade:

```
sudo pacman -Rdd linux-firmware
sudo pacman -Syu linux-firmware
```
