# 1. はじめに

パンは人類史上最も古い調理食品の一つであり、その起源は農業の黎明期までに1万年以上遡ります。 狩猟採集生活から農業生活への人類の移行を意味し、今日私たちが知っている社会の基盤を築いている。 人類と同じように、小麦粉、水、塩、酵母など、同じ基本的な食材を使用しながら、初期のフラットブレッドから無数の品種に進化してきました。

# 2. BredOS

At BredOS, we cherish the concept of using basic ingredients—selected with love and passion—to craft a simple yet versatile product that you can customize to your taste. Served plain, it has the potential to transform into whatever you desire. Whether sweet or salty, light or dark, big enough to enjoy it with your family or small enough to carry it around your adventures.
